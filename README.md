# Brandon Shell
This is a class assignment where I had to make a shell with some simple commands
# About My Shell
This is a very basic shell that should be able to perform input and output redirection.
Among other things, it can perform relative path search for commands like `ls`, but if
you chose, you are more than welcome to type out the absolute path like `/bin/ls`.
Commands are also able to accept different parameters for the program, like `ls -l`.
# Built-ins
This shell has a few commands that will run locally within the process itself.
These commands are, `cd <path>`, `pwd`, `exit`, and `version`.
